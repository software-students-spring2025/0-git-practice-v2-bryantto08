The article discusses a new AI Model created by a Chinese startup called DeepSeek. The LLM only cost about $5.6 million to build and yet is comparable to other models such as OpenAI's o1 in a variety of benchmark tests, causing alot of panic in the western world, most notably through share valuations, where Nvidia Shares dropped in record amounts yesterday. These events are signaling multiple shifts in the AI industry, both with a larger focus on developing the reasoning capabilities of AI, rather than simple creating a larger model, and also leveraging open source models as a way to increase innovation.
